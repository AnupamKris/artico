# Getting Started

## Try It Online

You can see Artico in action in this [online demo](https://demo.artico.dev).
If you'd like to remove any signaling from the equation and play around with the [Peer](/reference/peer) functionality, take a look a the [peer demo](https://peer.artico.dev) instead.

## Installation

For the purposes of the guide, we will demonstrate how to use Artico's client library, which provides out of the box signaling and relies on a public signaling server hosted by the Artico team.
Please refer to the documentation to learn how to use Artico's libraries in a way that fits your application requirements.
